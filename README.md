# HR Analytics Project – Workforce Summary

## Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory and visual analysis of a company's HR dataset to extract key insights into employee performance, engagement, demographics, and departmental trends. The Excel-based analysis focuses on departments, staff demographics, tenure, performance bands, and satisfaction scores.

##  Contents

* **HR Project.xlsx**
  A multi-sheet Excel workbook with raw data, cleaned and transformed datasets, pivot tables, and dashboards.

* **HR Project Summary Report.docx**
  An interpretive document presenting the main insights and actions derived from the analysis by department, manager, and time period.

* **HR Project - Workflow Descriptions.docx**
  A breakdown of the data cleaning and transformation workflow applied in Excel.

##  Data Preparation & Transformation

Steps included:

* Column renaming, whitespace trimming, and syntax corrections
* Derived fields such as Age, Tenure, Work Days, and Absence %
* Categorisation into bands (e.g. salary, tenure, age)
* Composite scoring combining engagement and satisfaction metrics

Full process documented in `HR Project - Workflow Descriptions.docx`.

##  Key Insights

Highlights from the analysis (detailed in the Summary Report):

* Production is the most critical and under-pressure department, with high turnover and performance variance
* IT/IS shows high absenteeism and gender pay disparity
* Sales has the highest underperformance rate, but lowest turnover
* Several outstanding and underperforming managers and staff have been identified
